**Devonian Lithological Database**

Public SQLite Version


Access to DLD is recommended via one of the free apps available on the Mac App Store or the iOS App Store.  However, you are welcome to use the actual database stored here.  

This version of the database (v. 3.1124) is the FINAL version 3 release.  Details of version 4 will be released when available.

**Opening in SQLite**

The stored file is a SQLite dump file.  That means the contents of the database has been "dumped" into a platform independent text file.

To reconstruct from from a Linux or Mac command line:

`sqlite3 myDatabaseFile < dld.dump`

Once the database is created, you can open it via the command line or use one of the many tools to open and use SQLite databases.  For example, SQLite Manager for Firefox.
